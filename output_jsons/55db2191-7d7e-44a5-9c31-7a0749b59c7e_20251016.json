This review emphasizes the nutritional and therapeutic traits of date fruit, focusing on its role as a functional food and dietary supplement. Rich in essential nutrients, antioxidants, and bioactive moieties, date fruit has been shown to provide numerous health benefits. These include managing metabolic disorders such as dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia, liver toxicity, kidney toxicity, obesity, and cardiovascular diseases. Studies exhibit that regular date consumption can contribute to the prevention of chronic illnesses and promote overall health and well-being. However, while research on individual bioactive compounds has been extensive, the full biological effects of the fruit, particularly in synergistic contexts, are not yet fully understood. This review consolidates and critically evaluates recent in&#xa0;vitro, in&#xa0;vivo, and clinical findings on date fruit's bioactive substances, particularly flavonoids, phenolic acids, and dietary fiber, and their role in modulating metabolic disease. Unlike previous studies, this review highlights the specific models and effective dosages: for example, animal studies using 300-1000&#x2009;mg/kg/day of date extracts showed improvements in lipid profiles and antioxidant enzyme activity (SOD, CAT, GST), while in&#xa0;vitro assays at 60-600&#x2009;&#x3bc;g/mL demonstrated anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic mechanisms via NF-&#x3ba;B inhibition and cytokine downregulation (IL-6, COX-2, TNF-&#x3b1;). Furthermore, HPLC-ESI-MS profiling showed cultivar-specific differences in polyphenol content and antioxidant potential. The paper also explores lesser-studied effects such as neuroprotection, immunomodulation, and antitumor activity. By integrating dosage-specific mechanistic insights and model-based outcomes, this review offers a more targeted framework for developing functional foods and nut\",\n      \"uid\": \"40927049\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"published\": \"2025-08-02\",\n      \"title\": \"An Overview of Buckwheat-A Superfood with Applicability in Human Health and Food Packaging.\",\n      \"copyright\": \"\",\n      \"summary\": \"Buckwheat, a dicotyledonous pseudocereal from the Polygonaceae family, has emerged as a crop of scientific and industrial interest due to its exceptional phytochemical profile, adaptability to different environments, and minimal agronomic input requirements. This paper aims to highlight the proximate composition (carbohydrates, protein, dietary fiber, lipids, starch, vitamins, and minerals) of the buckwheat principal species, <i>Fagopyrum esculentum</i> Moench (common buckwheat) and <i>Fagopyrum tataricum</i> (L.) Gaertn (Tartary buckwheat). Other bioactive compounds, including flavonoids (e.g., rutin, quercetin), phenolic acids, and anthocyanins, were emphasized, together with their influence on human health. These constituents confer a broad range of biological activities such as anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antidiabetic, antihypertensive, and hypoglycemic effects. Moreover, buckwheat is inherently gluten-free, making it a valuable alternative in formulations targeting gluten-sensitive populations. Finally, the review addresses the possibility of using starch buckwheat as a raw material in starch-based films. Further research is needed to elucidate the potential of buckwheat starch as a viable material for the development of biodegradable food packaging films.\",\n      \"uid\": \"40733437\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"published\": \"2025-08-06\",\n      \"title\": \"Perspective: Are Grapes Worthy of the Moniker Superfood?\",\n      \"copyright\": \"\",\n      \"summary\": \"Superfood, an <i>au courant</i> word in the American vernacular, refers to mainstream foods that are basically individual components of the Mediterranean diet, i.e., berries, fish, olive oil, cruciferous vegetables, legumes, etc., and perceived as \\\"healthy.\\\" There is no regulation; the main source of information is the Internet.
