      "content": "Perfect! Here's your complete traditional non-veg food guide for Hyderabad - breakfast, lunch, and dinner at three different iconic spots:\n\n## 🌅 **BREAKFAST: Hotel Nayaab (Pattherghatti/Ghansi Bazaar)**\n\n**Location:** Ghansi Bazaar, Old City (near Charminar)\n**Timings:** 4:00 AM - 10:00 AM (Yes, they start at 4 AM!)\n\n**What to Order (All Non-Veg):**\n- **Paya Nahari** - Slow-cooked mutton trotters in rich, spicy gravy (MUST TRY!)\n- **Malai Paya** - Creamy version of paya\n- **Keema** - Minced mutton cooked with spices\n- **Gurda Bhaji** - Spicy kidney preparation\n- **Bheja Fry** - Brain fry\n\n**Pair with:** Fresh naan or roti\n**Price Range:** ₹80-300 per dish\n**Why Special:** This is THE most authentic Old Hyderabad breakfast experience. The rich, slow-cooked meat dishes are legendary and perfect for starting your day the traditional Hyderabadi way.\n\n---\n\n## 🌞 **LUNCH: Hotel Shadab (Charminar)**\n\n**Location:** High Court Road, Madina Circle, Charminar area\n**Timings:** 11:00 AM onwards\n\n**What to Order (All Non-Veg):**\n- **Hyderabadi Mutton Biryani** - Aromatic, flavorful, authentic Hyderabadi dum biryani\n- **Chicken Biryani** - Lighter option but equally delicious\n- **Patthar Ka Gosht** - Mutton cooked on hot stone slabs (signature dish!)\n- **Kebabs** - Seekh Kebabs, Shikampuri Kebabs\n- **Mutton Dalcha** - Mutton cooked with lentils\n\n**Accompaniments:**\n- Mirchi Ka Salan (spicy chili curry)\n- Dahi Ki Chutney (yogurt chutney)\n- Raita\n\n**Price Range:** ₹300-500 for a full meal\n**Why Special:** Shadab has been serving authentic Hyderabadi cuisine since generations. Located in the heart of Old City with a view of Charminar, it offers the quintessential Hyderabadi biryani experience.\n\n---\n\n## 🌙 **DINNER: Bawarchi Restaurant (RTC X Roads)**\n\n**Location:** Plot No. 44, RTC X Roads, Chikkadpally (New Nallakunta)\n**Timings:** 11:00 AM - 11:30 PM\n\n**What to Order (All Non-Veg):**\n- **Hyderabadi Mutton Biryani** - Their specialty, different style from Shadab\n- **Chicken 65 Biryani** - Spicy fried chicken mixed with biryani\n- **Apollo Fish** - Hyderabadi style spicy fried fish\n- **Mutton Pepper Fry** - Spicy dry mutton preparation\n- **Tangdi Kebab** - Chicken drumstick kebabs\n- **Mutton Keema Fry** - Dry minced mutton\n\n**Starters:**\n- Chicken Majestic\n- Mutton Seekh Kebabs\n\n**Price Range:** ₹350-600 for a full meal\n**Why Special:** Bawarchi is famous for its slightly different biryani style compared to Old City restaurants. It's more accessible (modern area), has great ambience, and serves generous portions. Known for consistency and quality.\n\n---\n\n## 🍖 **BONUS RECOMMENDATIONS:**\n\n**If you want variety:**\n- **Alternative Breakfast:** Sohail Hotel (Malakpet) - Famous for **Khichdi-Khatta-Keema** combo (rice porridge with tamarind curry and minced meat)\n- **Alternative Lunch:** Cafe Bahar (Himayatnagar) - Another biryani legend with excellent **Haleem** (during Ramadan) and **Patthar Ka Gosht**\n- **Alternative Dinner:** Shah Ghouse (Gachibowli or Tolichowki) - Open late night, famous for **Midnight Biryani**, kebabs, and curries\n\n---\n\n## 📝 **PRO TIPS:**\n\n1. **Breakfast:** Go early to Hotel Nayaab (7-8 AM is ideal). The Paya Nahari is rich and heavy, so come hungry!\n\n2. **Lunch:** Shadab gets crowded 1-3 PM. Try to reach by 12:30 PM or after 3 PM. Don't miss the Patthar Ka Gosht!\n\n3. **Dinner:** Bawarchi is always busy. Weekdays are better than weekends. Order their biryani - it's what made them famous.\n\n4. **Spice Levels:** All these places serve spicy food. If you're sensitive, mention \"medium spicy\" or \"less spicy\" when ordering.\n\n5. **Accompaniments:** Always order Mirchi Ka Salan and Raita with biryani - they complete the experience.\n\n6. **Desserts:** After dinner at Bawarchi, try **Qubani Ka Meetha** (apricot dessert) or **Double Ka Meetha** (bread pudding)\n\n---\n\n## 🗺️ **FOOD TRAIL ROUTE:**\n\nAll three locations are in different parts of Hyderabad, giving you a complete city experience:\n- **Morning:** Old City (Heritage area) - Hotel Nayaab\n- **Afternoon:** Charminar area (Historic center) - Hotel Shadab  \n- **Evening:** Modern Hyderabad (RTC X Roads) - Bawarchi\n\nThis way, you'll experience traditional Old City cuisine in the morning/afternoon and modern Hyderabad in the evening, while maximizing your non-veg food experience!\n\n**Happy eating! 🍖🍗🥘** Hyderabad's non-veg cuisine is legendary for a reason - you're in for an amazing culinary journey!"
