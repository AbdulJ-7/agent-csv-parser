      "content": "Page: Rubel Castle\nSummary: Rubel Castle (AKA Rubelia) was established in Glendora, California, by Michael Clarke Rubel (April 16, 1940 – October 15, 2007) and is owned and operated by the Glendora Historical Society.\nIn 1959, a teenage Michael Rubel purchased a 1.7-acre plot dominated by an old reservoir and packing house from a recently defunct citrus orchard. Continuing a childhood passion of building forts and other improvised structures, he and his friends soon embarked on a building program that was only completed in 1986.\nRubel Castle was constructed out of concrete as well as nontraditional materials including scrap steel, rocks, bedsprings, coat hangers, bottles, and other repurposed materials that Rubel salvaged from the neighborhood as the old ranches and barns were giving way to tract houses.\nTo this day, chickens and other animals are frequently sighted on the grounds.\n\nPage: Magic square\nSummary: In mathematics, especially historical and recreational mathematics, a square array of numbers, usually positive integers, is called a magic square if the sums of the numbers in each row, each column, and both main diagonals are the same. The order of the magic square is the number of integers along one side (n), and the constant sum is called the magic constant. If the array includes just the positive integers \n  \n    \n      \n        1\n        ,\n        2\n        ,\n        .\n        .\n        .\n        ,\n        \n          n\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 1,2,...,n^{2}}\n  \n, the magic square is said to be normal. Some authors take magic square to mean normal magic square.\nMagic squares that include repeated entries do not fall under this definition and are referred to as trivial. Some well-known examples, including the Sagrada Família magic square are trivial in this sense. When all the rows and columns but not both diagonals sum to the magic constant, this gives a semimagic square (sometimes called orthomagic square).\nThe mathematical study of magic squares typically deals with its construction, classification, and enumeration. Although completely general methods for producing all the magic squares of all orders do not exist, historically three general techniques have been discovered: by bordering, by making composite magic squares, and by adding two preliminary squares. There are also more specific strategies like the continuous enumeration method that reproduces specific patterns. Magic squares are generally classified according to their order n as: odd if n is odd, evenly even (also referred to as \"doubly even\") if n is a multiple of 4, oddly even (also known as \"singly even\") if n is any other even number. This classification is based on different techniques required to construct odd, evenly even, and oddly even squares. Beside this, depending on further properties, magic squares are also classified as associative magic squares, pandiagonal magic squares, most-perfect magic squares, and so on. More challengingly, attempts have also been made to classify all the magic squares of a given order as transformations of a smaller set of squares. Except for n ≤ 5, the enumeration of higher-order magic squares is still an open challenge. The enumeration of most-perfect magic squares of any order was only accomplished in the late 20th century.\nMagic squares have a long history, dating back to at least 190 BCE in China. At various times they have acquired occult or mythical significance, and have appeared as symbols in works of art. In modern times they have been generalized a number of ways, including using extra or different constraints, multiplying instead of adding cells, using alternate shapes or more than two dimensions, and replacing numbers with shapes and addition with geometric operations.\n\nPage: Barcelona\nSummary: Barcelona (  BAR-sə-LOH-nə; Catalan: [bəɾsəˈlonə] ; Spanish: [baɾθeˈlona] ) is a city on the northeastern coast of Spain.

      "content": "The Sagrada Familia, designed by Antoni Gaudí, is a monumental basilica located in Barcelona that has been under construction since 1882. It is renowned for its unique architectural style, a blend of Gothic and Art Nouveau forms, and represents Gaudí's interpretation of nature, with organic shapes and vibrant colors. The monument was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1984, with its various facades symbolizing different aspects of Christian belief, particularly the life of Jesus and the Holy Family. Today, it is one of the most visited monuments in Spain, attracting approximately 4.5 million visitors annually. Portions of the structure are open to the public, including access to the nave, crypt, museum, and some towers. The basilica was consecrated and declared a minor basilica in 2010, and it is expected to be completed by 2026, making it not only a significant architectural project but also a symbol of faith and perseverance."
