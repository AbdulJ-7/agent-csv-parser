      "content": "Here's a summary of recent global market and export price trends for chia seeds and avocados, plus an outlook if the current trend continues:\n\nAVOCADO:\n- Global avocado market value was approximately $19.5B USD in 2025 and is expected to reach $26.5B by 2030 (CAGR from 6–9%, depending on the source).\n- Market research forecasts estimate values as high as $30–47B by 2032–2035, with growth driven by health trends, plant-based diets, and rising demand in markets like China.\n- Avocado export value grew from $6.3B in 2019 to $7.3B in 2023 (about 15% growth). Year-on-year growth in export value was 4.1% from 2022 to 2023.\n- Export prices and demand are robust, with production regions like Peru expected to grow avocado exports by 37% in 2025 after overcoming supply challenges in 2024.\n- Most market reports project continued healthy growth over the next decade (various sources show CAGR of 6–9%).\n\nCHIA SEEDS:\n- The global chia seed market was valued at $1.5–1.7B USD in 2024–2025 and is projected to reach roughly $3.3B by 2030 (mostly cited CAGR of 13–15%).\n- Some industry reports suggest a possible tripling (291% growth) between 2024 and 2025, but the consistent average forecast is for about 13% CAGR through 2030.\n- Export data for 2024–2025 shows sharp growth: For example, India's chia seed shipments grew 29% YoY in September 2024, and 19% over just the previous month, indicating surging international demand.\n- Wholesale prices by region (recent examples): in Canada, Q4 2023 chia seed prices reached about $1,955 USD/MT; the UK saw $2,175 USD/MT. Ukraine saw 189 UAH/kg in early 2025. Price trends indicate steady or rising averages, especially for organic/clean-label varieties.\n\nOUTLOOK IF THE TREND CONTINUES:\n- Avocado global market is projected to continue a steady CAGR of 6–9% through 2030+. This would mean a total market two to three times larger by 2035 if demand persists at current rates.\n- Chia seed market, with a 13–15% CAGR, could double about every five years, reaching over $3B by 2030 and possibly surpassing $6B by 2035.\n- Export prices for both products appear stable to slightly rising, reflecting strong demand relative to supply, and driven by their popularity as health foods in cafes and wellness markets worldwide.\n- If cafes and consumer preference trends keep holding or increase, both chia and avocado are very likely to see continued growth in market size and prices over at least the next 5–10 years."
