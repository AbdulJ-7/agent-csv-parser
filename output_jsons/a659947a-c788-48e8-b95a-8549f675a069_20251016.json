      "content": "Page: Qutb Minar\nSummary: The Qutb Minar, also spelled Qutub Minar and Qutab Minar, is a minaret and victory tower comprising the Qutb complex, which lies at the site of Delhi's oldest fortified city, Lal Kot, founded by the Tomar Rajputs. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site in the Mehrauli area of South Delhi, India. It was mostly built between 1199 and 1220, contains 399 steps, and is one of the most-frequented heritage spots in the city. After defeating Prithviraj Chauhan, the last Hindu ruler of Delhi before the Ghurid conquest of the region, Qutab-ud-din Aibak initiated the construction of the victory tower, but only managed to finish the first level. It was to mark the beginning of Islamic rule in the region. Successive dynasties of the Delhi Sultanate continued the construction, and, in 1368, Firuz Shah Tughlaq rebuilt the top parts and added a cupola.\nIt can be compared to the 62-metre all-brick Minaret of Jam in Afghanistan, of c. 1190, which was constructed a decade or so before the probable start of the Delhi tower. The surfaces of both are elaborately decorated with inscriptions and geometric patterns. The Qutb Minar has a shaft that is fluted with \"superb stalactite bracketing under the balconies\" at the top of each stage. In general, minarets were slow to be used in India and are often detached from the main mosque where they exist.\nIn recent years, the Qutub Minar has been illuminated for special occasions involving international relations. In September 2023, the monument was lit up in the colours of the Mexican flag to commemorate Mexico's 213th Independence Day, an event that was acknowledged and appreciated by the Embassy of Mexico in India. Similarly, on October 30, the Qutub Minar was illuminated with the Turkish flag to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Republic of Turkey, an occasion that received special attention from the Turkish Embassy in New Delhi.\n\nPage: Qutb Minar complex\nSummary: The Qutb Minar complex are monuments and buildings from the Delhi Sultanate at Mehrauli in Delhi, India. Construction of the Qutub Minar \"victory tower\" in the complex, named after the religious figure Sufi Saint Khwaja Qutbuddin Bakhtiar Kaki, was begun by Qutb-ud-din Aibak, who later became the first Sultan of Delhi of the Mamluk dynasty (Gulam Vansh). It was continued by his successor Iltutmish (a.k.a. Altamash), and finally completed much later by Firoz Shah Tughlaq, a Sultan of Delhi from the Tughlaq dynasty (1320–1412) in 1368 AD. The Qubbat-ul-Islam Mosque (Dome of Islam), later corrupted into Quwwat-ul Islam, stands next to the Qutb Minar.\nMany subsequent rulers, including the Tughlaqs, Alauddin Khalji and the British added structures to the complex. Apart from the Qutb Minar and the Quwwat ul-Islam Mosque, other structures in the complex include the Alai Darwaza gate, the Alai Minar and the Iron pillar.\nInside the complex lie the tombs of Iltutmish, Alauddin Khalji and Imam Zamin.\nToday, the adjoining area spread over with a host of old monuments, including Balban's tomb, has been developed by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) as the Mehrauli Archaeological Park, and INTACH has restored some 40 monuments in the Park. It is also the venue of the annual 'Qutub Festival', held in November–December, where artists, musicians and dancers perform over three days.\n\nPage: Mini Qutub Minar\nSummary: The Mini Qutub Minar (local: Chhota Qutub Minar, Mini Minar, Kaushal Minar, Hastsal ki Laat) is a minaret tower in Hastsal village, near Uttam Nagar in West Delhi, Delhi, India. It was built in the 1650 by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan (reign, 1628-1658) near his hunting lodge in Hasthal.  The three-storey tower is 16.87 meters (55 feet) tall and stands on a raised octagonal platform. The minar (minaret) is built with bricks and clad with red sandstone. The tower structure and design resembles the Qutub Minar of Delhi and was inspired by it.\nOriginally, the Mini Qutub Minar was a 5-storey tower, topped out with a do"

It was constructed to commemorate the victory over Prithviraj Chauhan, the last Hindu ruler of Delhi. The Qutub Minar complex includes several other significant structures, such as the Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque and the Iron Pillar of Delhi, which stands as a testament to ancient engineering. The design of the Qutub Minar includes intricate carvings and inscriptions, showcasing the artistry of the time. Later, the monument was completed by Aibak's successor, Iltutmish, and further enhanced by Firuz Shah Tughlaq in the 14th century."
