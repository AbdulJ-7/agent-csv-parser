Thus, the demand for a\\ncarbon dioxide capture material is massive and continuously increasing. In this\\nstudy, we perform first-principle calculations based on density functional\\ntheory to investigate the carbon dioxide capture ability of pristine and doped\\nberyllonitrene. Our results show that carbon dioxide had an adsorption energy\\nof -0.046 eV on pristine beryllonitrene, so it appears that beryllonitrene has\\nextremely weak carbon dioxide adsorption ability. Pristine beryllonitrene could\\nbe effectively doped with Lithium atoms, and the resulting Li-doped\\nberyllonitrene had much stronger interactions with carbon dioxide than pristine\\nberyllonitrene. The adsorption energy for carbon dioxide on Li-doped\\nberyllonitrene was -0.408 eV. The adsorption of carbon dioxide on Li-doped\\nberyllonitrene greatly changed the charge density, projected density of states,\\nand band structure of the material, demonstrating that it was strongly\\nadsorbed. This suggests that Li-doping is a viable way to enhance the carbon\\ndioxide capture ability of beryllonitrene and makes it a possible candidate for\\nan effective CO$_2$ capture material.\",\n      \"published\": \"2021-10-06\",\n      \"arxiv_id\": \"2110.02512v1\",\n      \"pdf_url\": \"http://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.02512v1\",\n      \"categories\": [\n        \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\"\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"title\": \"Poly(ionic liquid)-Derived Carbon with Site-Specific N-Doping and Biphasic Heterojunction for Enhanced CO2 Capture and Sensing\",\n      \"authors\": \"Jiang Gong, Markus Antonietti, Jiayin Yuan\",\n      \"summary\": \"CO2 capture is a pressing global environmental issue that drives scientists\\nto develop creative strategies for tackling this challenge.

Here, we show\\nthat the production of chemical sorbents could have significant implications on\\nsystem cost, energy use and material use depending on how much they are\\nconsumed. Among the three chemical sorbents investigated, namely\\nmonoethanolamine (MEA) for post-combustion carbon capture, potassium hydroxide\\nfor liquid direct air capture and polyethylenimine-silica (PEI) for solid\\nsorbent direct air capture, we found that the production of the compound for\\nsolid sorbent direct air capture represent the highest uncertainties for the\\nsystem. At the high range of solid sorbent consumption, total energy system\\ncost increased by up to 6.5\\\\%, while effects for other options were small to\\nnegligible.

In a direct comparison, a\\nhydrogen network is more cost-effective than a carbon network, as it serves to\\ntransport hydrogen to demand and to point source of carbon for utilization.\\nHowever, in a hybrid scenario where both networks are present, the carbon\\nnetwork effectively complements the hydrogen network, promoting carbon capture\\nfrom distributed biomass and reducing reliance on direct air capture.

      "content": "Here are concise, up-to-date answers to your questions about ExxonMobil and carbon capture:\n\n**1. Techniques used by ExxonMobil to Capture Carbon:**\nExxonMobil employs several approaches for carbon capture and storage (CCS):\n- **Post-combustion capture using amine solvents:** Capturing CO2 from industrial sources (like natural gas processing and power plants) by absorbing it in chemical solvents (e.g., monoethanolamine), then compressing and storing the concentrated CO2 underground.\n- **Carbonate fuel cell technology:** In partnership with FuelCell Energy, ExxonMobil is developing carbonate fuel cells that capture CO2 from power plant flue gases while producing electricity. Pilot plants are advancing this approach for industrial-scale adoption.\n- **Direct Air Capture (DAC):** Through collaboration with Global Thermostat, ExxonMobil is exploring DAC, which removes CO2 directly from the atmosphere for storage or reuse.\n- **Collaboration for New Materials:** ExxonMobil has co-developed innovative adsorption materials (in partnership with UC Berkeley and Lawrence Berkeley Lab) that enable over 90% CO2 capture from flue gas using low-temperature steam.\n- **Honeywell and Mitsubishi Technologies:** ExxonMobil also works with these companies to implement advanced CO2 fractionation, hydrogen purification, and efficient post-combustion capture at large facilities, e.g., its Baytown, TX site.\n- **CO2 pipelines and storage:** CO2 is transported by pipeline and permanently stored in underground geological formations (such as saline reservoirs or depleted oil/gas fields). ExxonMobil manages some of the world’s largest CO2 storage operations, especially along the U.S. Gulf Coast.\n\nFind more details at official sources:\n- https://corporate.exxonmobil.com/what-we-do/delivering-industrial-solutions/carbon-capture-and-storage\n- https://lowcarbon.exxonmobil.com/lower-carbon-technology/carbon-capture-and-storage\n- https://chemistry.berkeley.edu/news/exxonmobil-collaborates-discovery-new-material-enhance-carbon-capture-technology\n\n**2. ExxonMobil Stock Price (Ticker: XOM):**\n- **Current stock price:** $112.29 (as of October 15, 2025)\n- **Recent range:** 52-week high: $123.21 / 52-week low: $97.80\n- For real-time performance, see Yahoo Finance: https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/XOM\n\n**3. Competing Companies to ExxonMobil in Carbon Capture:**\nExxonMobil’s main competitors in CCS broadly include:\n- **Shell:** Major oil & gas company with large CCS projects (Quest, Canada, and Northern Lights, Norway).\n- **Chevron:** Significant investments in CCS at oil/gas fields (notably Gorgon, Australia).\n- **TotalEnergies:** Involved in EU CCS hubs (notably in the Netherlands and Norway).\n- **Occidental Petroleum (Oxy):** Active on enhanced oil recovery with CO2 and developing direct air capture.\n- **BP:** Coordinates CCS hubs in the UK (e.g., Net Zero Teesside, Northern Endurance Partnership).\n- **Equinor:** Norwegian leader in offshore carbon storage (Northern Lights project).\n\n**Other competing and innovating companies (not oil supermajors):**\n- **Climeworks:** World leader in direct air capture (Iceland, Switzerland).\n- **Carbon Clean:** Leading developer of modular capture systems.\n- **Aker Carbon Capture, Air Products, SLB Capturi (Schlumberger), Heirloom, Blue Skies Minerals, UP Catalyst**—all actively building/operating carbon capture at scale.\n\n**Summary:**\n- ExxonMobil leverages a broad suite of CCS approaches: advanced solvent and sorbent systems, carbonate fuel cells, direct air capture, and large-scale CO2 storage.\n- The XOM stock price is $112.29.\n- Competing companies range from oil majors (Shell, Chevron, Equinor, BP, TotalEnergies, Oxy) to specialized technology startups (Climeworks, Carbon Clean, Aker) implementing or supplying similar solutions.\n\nLet me know if you need deeper technical details about ExxonMobil’s specific pilot plants, technologies, or a comparison of competitors’ approaches."

        "I have gathered the latest analyst forecasts and news regarding ExxonMobil (XOM) stock. Multiple sources project a modest upside, with consensus 2025 price targets in the $120-$125 range (current price: ~$112), and several analyst reports and news articles highlight dividend increases and improving upstream earnings due to higher oil prices. While there are mentions of market volatility and sector risks, the overall forecast for the near-to-medium term is mildly positive. I will now provide a detailed, clear final answer summarizing whether XOM is expected to increase or decrease."

      "content": "The latest analyst consensus and financial news suggest that ExxonMobil (XOM) stock price is expected to see a modest increase in the near-to-medium term. Most 2025 analyst price targets fall in the range of $120–$125 per share, up from the current price of $112.29 (as of October 15, 2025). Key drivers for this outlook include:\n\n- **Analyst Forecasts:** Multiple independent forecasts (e.g., CoinCodex, MarketBeat, Yahoo Finance, LiteFinance) set year-end 2025 targets from $120 to $125. Some bullish estimates go as high as $135 or beyond, but the consensus target is around $124–$125.\n- **Recent Financial News:** Reports from Reuters (October 2025) indicate Exxon expects a profit boost in Q3 from higher oil prices. Several outlets (Seeking Alpha, Motley Fool) continue to highlight XOM’s strong dividend policy and capital discipline.\n- **Dividends:** ExxonMobil is projected to continue increasing its dividends, making it an appealing stock for income investors.\n- **Risks:** Some analysts note volatility due to oil price swings and global economic concerns, but there is broad agreement that the long-term outlook is stable to slightly positive.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- **Prediction:** Most forecasts anticipate a moderate increase in ExxonMobil’s stock price over the coming months. The increase is not expected to be dramatic, but current sentiment is mildly positive with continued growth potential and dividend stability.\n- **Caveats:** The stock’s performance remains linked to oil prices and broader market conditions, so some risk remains.\n\n**Summary:**\n- XOM is forecast to rise from $112.29 toward $120–$125 in late 2025.\n- Analyst sentiment: Mildly bullish.\n- Ongoing strong dividend yield and recent earnings boost from energy prices.\n\nIf you would like a summary or links to specific analyst reports, or you want to compare ExxonMobil to its peers, please let me know."
