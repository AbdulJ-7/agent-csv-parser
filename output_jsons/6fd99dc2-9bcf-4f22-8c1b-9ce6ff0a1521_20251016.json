      "content": "Page: The Collected Works of C. G. Jung\nSummary: The Collected Works of C. G. Jung (German: Gesammelte Werke) is a book series containing the first collected edition, in English translation, of the major writings of Swiss psychiatrist Carl Gustav Jung.\nThe twenty volumes, including a Bibliography and a General Index, were translated from the original German by R.F.C. Hull, under the editorship of Sir Herbert Read, Michael Fordham and Gerhard Adler. The works consist of published volumes, essays, lectures, letters, and a dissertation written by Jung from 1902 until his death in 1961. The compilation by the documentary editors dates from 1945 onward. The series contains revised versions of works previously published, works not previously translated, and new translations of many of Jung's writings. Several of the volumes are extensively illustrated; each contains an index and most contain a bibliography. Until his death, Jung supervised the revisions of the text, some of which were extensive. A body of Jung's work still remains unpublished.\nPrinceton University Press published these volumes in the United States as part of its Bollingen Series of books. Routledge & Kegan Paul published them independently in the United Kingdom. In general, the Princeton editions are not available for sale in The Commonwealth, except for Canada, and the Routledge editions are not available for sale in the US. There are many differences in publication dates between the Princeton and Routledge series, as well as some differences in edition numbers and the styling of titles; there are also various hardback and paperback versions, as well as some ebooks, available from both publishers, each with its own ISBN. This article shows dates and titles for hardback (cloth) volumes in the catalog of the Princeton University Press, which also includes paperback and ebook versions. Information about the Routledge series can be found in its own catalogue.\nA digital edition, complete except for the General Index in Volume 20, is also available. Both the individual volumes and the complete set are fully searchable.\n\nPage: Technical analysis\nSummary: In finance, technical analysis is an analysis methodology for analysing and forecasting the direction of prices through the study of past market data, primarily price and volume. As a type of active management, it stands in contradiction to much of modern portfolio theory. The efficacy of technical analysis is disputed by the efficient-market hypothesis, which states that stock market prices are essentially unpredictable, and research on whether technical analysis offers any benefit has produced mixed results. It is distinguished from fundamental analysis, which considers a company's financial statements, health, and the overall state of the market and economy.\n\n\n\nPage: PubMed\nSummary: PubMed is an openly accessible, free database which includes primarily the MEDLINE database of references and abstracts on life sciences and biomedical topics. The United States National Library of Medicine (NLM) at the National Institutes of Health maintains the database as part of the Entrez system of information retrieval.\nFrom 1971 to 1997, online access to the MEDLINE database was provided via computer,\nphone lines primarily through institutional facilities, such as university libraries. PubMed, first released in January 1996, ushered in the era of private, free, home- and office-based MEDLINE searching. The PubMed system was offered free to the public starting in June 1997.\n\n"

Integration of Novel Techniques in Agricultural Biotechnology\nBaianu et al. (2004) discuss the importance of advanced biotechnological methods such as immobilized bacterial cells and enzymes, microencapsulation, genetic manipulation of microorganisms, development of plant-derived vaccines, and bioinformatics tools. The paper highlights both fundamental and applied aspects, as well as policy considerations critical to expanding biotechnology's role in sustainable agriculture and food production. \n[Citation: Baianu, I.

Applications of Novel Techniques to Health Foods, Medical and Agricultural Biotechnology. arXiv:0406047v1. http://arxiv.org/pdf/q-bio/0406047v1]\n\n2. Precision Agriculture Supported by the Internet of Everything (IoE)\nBabar & Akan (2024) illustrate the convergence of biotechnology with AI, robotics, IoT, blockchain, and molecular communication under the IoE paradigm. Their analysis underscores the transformative impact of combining IoE with nano- and bio-nano technologies (such as designer phages and Internet of Bio-Nano Things) to enable real-time, molecular-scale precision in crop monitoring, resource management, and disease control. The paper identifies challenges and future research avenues for achieving resilient, high-efficiency digital agriculture ecosystems.\n[Citation: Babar, A. Z., & Akan, O. B. (2024). Sustainable and Precision Agriculture with the Internet of Everything (IoE). arXiv:2404.06341v3. http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.06341v3]\n\n3. Knowledge-Guided Machine Learning for Environmental Impact in Agriculture\nZhang et al. (2025) propose an integrated knowledge-guided graph neural network framework for predicting soil greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes, critical for environmental assessment and emission mitigation. Their model leverages both simulated and real-world multidimensional data, applying autoencoders to distill key features and graph neural networks to understand correlations, outperforming traditional regression approaches for precision GHG management.\n[Citation: Zhang, Y., Bi, G., Jeffery, S., Davis, M., Li, Y., Xue, Q., & Yang, P. (2025). KG-FGNN: Knowledge-guided GNN Foundation Model for Fertilisation-oriented Soil GHG Flux Prediction. arXiv:2506.15896v1. http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15896v1]\n\n4. Communication Technologies Enabling Agriculture 4.0\nAldhaheri et al. (2024) survey Long Range (LoRa) wireless systems as a backbone for smart agriculture IoT networks. Their review identifies best practices for network architecture, energy management, sensor deployment, as well as current limitations and future needs such as robust routing, integration of advanced drone and imaging sensors, on-device AI, and scaling sustainable solutions. Effective communication networks are shown to be foundational for integrating and deploying advanced biotech applications at scale.\n[Citation: Aldhaheri, L., Alshehhi, N., Manzil, I. I.

LoRa Communication for Agriculture 4.0: Opportunities, Challenges, and Future Directions. arXiv:2409.11200v1. http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.11200v1]\n\n5. Data-Centric Approaches in Digital Agriculture\nRoscher et al. (2023) argue for a paradigm shift in digital agriculture from model-centric machine learning to data-centric strategies—emphasizing data acquisition, curation, and evaluation. This is crucial for the development of robust, adaptable, and generalizable ML methods that address key agricultural tasks (e.g., yield prediction and disease detection).

Therefore, this study aimed to conduct a correlation analysis of various traits gathered from years of research on the 120 Cheongcheong Nagdong Double Haploid (CNDH) population to identify key traits responsible for methane emission in rice. This study focused on practical plant traits, including culm length, spikelets per panicle, and grain weight, which have a positive correlation with methane emission. Shorter culm lengths produce less biomass, thereby reducing the organic matter available to feed methane-producing microbes. Increasing the number of spikelets per panicle increase boosts grain production, thereby reducing the development of root exudates that contribute to methane production. Our results indicate a positive correlation (r&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.51) between grain weight and methane emissions, suggesting that selecting for heavier grains may actually increase methane emissions. Based on these features, we propose an rice ideotype variety that possibly minimizes the rice plant methane emissions while maintaining a high yield. This paper suggests that future studies should be extended to validate these current findings and explore the genetic components and ecological aspects of methane emissions to improve methane management in sustainable rice farming systems.\",\n      \"uid\": \"40052443\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"published\": \"2025-05-06\",\n      \"title\": \"Knockout of fatty acid elongase1 homeoalleles in amphidiploid Brassica juncea leads to undetectable erucic acid in seed oil.\",\n      \"copyright\": \"\",\n      \"summary\": \"Indian mustard (Brassica juncea L.) is a major oilseed crop with considerable economic and nutritional importance globally. While its seed oil offers valuable dietary benefits due to a balanced ratio of human essential fatty acids, the traditional high oil-yielding varieties contain an elevated level of erucic acid (EA, C22:1) associated with adverse health effects. Therefore, developing low erucic acid (LEA) mustard cultivars is crucial for broader utilization and consumer safety. In this study, CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing tool was employed to disrupt the fatty acid elongase1 (FAE1) gene that encodes a key enzyme in EA biosynthesis in two high erucic acid (HEA) B. juncea cultivars, PCR7 (&#x223c;39% EA) and JD6 (&#x223c;45% EA). Targeted knockout (KO) of BjFAE1 homeoalleles (BjFAE1.1 and BjFAE1.2) in this amphidiploid plant species using CRISPR/Cas9 constructs, each carrying two guide RNAs led to generation of single (either fae1.1 or fae1.2) and double (fae1.1fae1.2) mutants. Best performing homozygous fae1.1fae1.2 KO lines showed a near-complete elimination of EA in both the cultivars (&lt;0.5% in PCR7, undetectable in JD6) with a marked increase in nutritionally beneficial oleic acid (from &#x223c;18% to &#x223c;32% in PCR7, from &#x223c;9% to &#x223c;38% in JD6). Moreover, the content of essential fatty acids also increased substantially [linoleic acid (C18:2) 1.9-fold in PCR7 and 2.1-fold in JD6; linolenic acid (C18:3) 2.5-fold in PCR7 and 1.4-fold in JD6], suggesting rerouting of carbon flux from EA biosynthesis. Importantly, these LEA lines retained key agronomic traits like plant seed yield and oil content, matching the productivity of the unedited control elite cultivars. Our findings underscore the effectiveness of CRISPR/Cas9 technology for editing B. juncea genome, developing plant lines producing LEA seed oil with improved nutritional quality and broadening the utility of this important oilseed crop for food and non-food applications.\",\n      \"uid\": \"40020602\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"published\": \"2025-04-28\",\n      \"title\": \"Engineering a robust Cas12i3 variant-mediated wheat genome editing system.\",\n      \"copyright\": \"\",\n      \"summary\": \"Wheat (Triticum aestivum L., 2n&#x2009;=&#x2009;6x&#x2009;=&#x2009;42, AABBDD) is one of the most important food crops in the world. CRISPR/Cas12i3, which belongs to the type V-I Cas system, has attracted extensive attention recently due to its smaller protein size and its less-restricted canonical 'TTN' protospacer adjacent motif (PAM). However, due to its relatively lower editing efficacy in plants and the hexaploidy complex nature of wheat, Cas12i3/Cas12i3-5M-mediated genome editing in wheat has not been documented yet. Here, we report the engineering of a robust Cas12i3-5M-mediated genome editing system in wheat through the fusion of T5 exonuclease (T5E) in combination with an optimised crRNA expression strategy (Opt). We first showed that fusion of T5E, rather than ExoI, to Cas12i3-5M increased the gene editing efficiencies by up to 1.34-fold and 3.87-fold, compared to Cas12i3-5M and Cas12i3 in HEK293T&#xa0;cells, respectively. However, its editing efficiency remains low in wheat. We then optimised the crRNA expression strategy and demonstrated that Opt-T5E-Cas12i3-5M could enhance the editing efficiency by 1.20- to 1.33-fold and 4.05- to 7.95-fold in wheat stable lines compared to Opt-Cas12i3-5M and Opt-Cas12i3, respectively, due to progressive 5'-end resection of the DNA strand at the cleavage site with increased deletion size. The Opt-T5E-Cas12i3-5M enabled an editing efficiency ranging from 60.71% to 90.00% across four endogenous target genes in stable lines of three elite Chinese wheat varieties. Together, the developed robust Opt-T5E-Cas12i3-5M system enriches wheat genome editing toolkits for either biological research or genetic improvement and may be extended to other important polyploidy crop species.\",\n      \"uid\": \"39690508\"\n    }\n  ]\n}"
