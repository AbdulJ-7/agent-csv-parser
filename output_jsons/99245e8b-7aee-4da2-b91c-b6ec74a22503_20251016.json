They act as an extra cost for foreign products when they enter a country, making domestic products comparatively cheaper. President Trump imposed several tariffs during his administration. Notably, he implemented a 25% additional tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico, and a 10% additional tariff on imports from China. Additionally, he threatened 100% tariffs on certain Chinese goods, particularly those related to rare earth minerals, and announced a 50% tariff on copper imports."
