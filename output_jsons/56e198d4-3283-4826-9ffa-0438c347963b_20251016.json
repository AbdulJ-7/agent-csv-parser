[Read PDF](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.05633v1)\n\nThese papers show that quantum randomness and computation genuinely allow new strategies and behaviors in games not possible with classical randomness, making in-game AI and mechanics potentially much more realistic and unpredictable.\n\n**Video Breakdowns Explaining How This Works:**\n- [Revolutionizing Gameplay: The Role of Quantum Computing in Video Games (ShortPress, 0:38)](https://youtu.be/ta-TsaHxAgU) – Brief overview on how quantum computing could transform video game mechanics using true randomness and advanced computation.\n- [Here’s What Will Happen When We Combine Quantum Computing With AI!

Here is a summary of updates made to the second edition. This book discusses mental health and community health concepts while emphasizing stress management techniques, healthy coping strategies, referrals to community resources, and other preventative interventions. Nursing care for individuals with specific mental health and substance use disorders is examined, and the nurse&#x2019;s role in community health needs assessments and caring for vulnerable populations is introduced. Overall updates to the second edition were made based on feedback received from a WTCS faculty workgroup and include the following: Learning objectives were updated based on revised WTCS state curriculum. Content, including DSM-5 criteria and definitions, was updated with content from DSM-5-TR. Content based on the ANA Code of Ethics was updated to reflect the 2025 edition. Hyperlinks to supplementary information were updated. Nursing process sections were standardized across all chapters based on content originally included in Chapter 4 (&#x201c;Application of the Nursing Process to Mental Health Care&#x201d;). The NCSBN Clinical Judgment Measurement Model steps were included in parentheses next to the steps of the nursing process (e.g., Recognize Cues, Analyze Cues, Generate Solutions, Take Action, and Evaluate Outcomes).

This review summarises the scientific evidence and progress towards HCV elimination in correctional health systems. It outlines the evolution of 'test-and-treat' models, assesses micro-elimination success worldwide, especially in Singapore, and highlights collaborative efforts between Changi General Hospital and Singapore Prison Services. Their implementation of HCV treatment guidelines serves as a key case study in this context. This review also analyses the various barriers - structural, financial, clinical and logistical - that hinder progress. It consolidates strong evidence that prison-based HCV treatment is cost-effective, promotes health equity, supports the World Health Organization 2030 goals and reduces the societal burden of HCV.\",\n      \"uid\": \"41090317\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"published\": \"2025-10-15\",\n      \"title\": \"Nature-based therapy in healthcare: a focused review and prelude to an upcoming trial at a public tertiary hospital in Singapore.\",\n      \"copyright\": \"\",\n      \"summary\": \"The advances of modern medicine have inadvertently led to a globally ageing population plagued primarily with non-communicable diseases.

The existing quantum game theory papers show concepts and sometimes theoretical simulations, but do not feature hands-on code or playable demos using quantum sources.\n\nThe closest available resources:\n\n**Papers (theoretical or simulated, not hands-on demo):**\n- Parrondo Games and Quantum Algorithms (Lee & Johnson, 2002): Introduces quantum randomness into game strategies but is largely conceptual. [PDF](http://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/0203043v1)\n- Is the essence of a quantum game captured completely in the original classical game?

[PDF](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.08573v3)\n\n**Most relevant demo/prototype video found:**\n- [High-speed quantum random number generator prototype](https://youtu.be/CE4qXo-hYng) — Demonstrates an actual hardware prototype generating true quantum randomness, a key component for game demos that need real quantum input.\n\n**Other explainer/demo-adjacent videos:**\n- [Revolutionizing Gameplay: The Role of Quantum Computing in Video Games](https://youtu.be/ta-TsaHxAgU)\n- [GN! Recap: James Wootton - Quantum Computers for Game Development](https://youtu.be/mjO8WjmfpH0)\n\n**Summary:**\n- There is substantial theoretical and simulated research on quantum randomness in games, but as of now, peer-reviewed publications with actual playable demos or end-to-end prototypes using quantum randomness for game logic are not yet available. The best match is a demo of a quantum random number device, which real games could use for logic, while implementation in full game logic is mostly at the academic or experimental stage.\n\nIf you want hands-on quantum-powered game logic, open-source and corporate research groups are working on it, but no complete peer-reviewed demo papers are published yet.

A co-founder of PayPal, Palantir Technologies, and Founders Fund, he was the first outside investor in Facebook. According to Forbes, as of May 2025, Thiel's estimated net worth stood at US$20.8 billion, making him the 103rd-richest individual in the world. Thiel has been described as \"intellectual architect of Silicon Valley's contemporary ethos\".\nBorn in Germany, Thiel was brought to the US by his parents when he was one year old. In 1971, his family moved to South Africa then South West Africa, before moving back to the US in 1977. After graduating from Stanford, he worked as a clerk, a securities lawyer, a speechwriter, and subsequently a derivatives trader at Credit Suisse. He founded Thiel Capital Management in 1996 and co-founded PayPal with Max Levchin and Luke Nosek in 1998. He was the chief executive officer of PayPal until its sale to eBay in 2002 for $1.5 billion.\nFollowing PayPal, Thiel founded Clarium Capital, a global macro hedge fund based in San Francisco. In 2003, he launched Palantir Technologies, a big data analysis company, and has been its chairman since its inception. In 2005, Thiel launched Founders Fund with PayPal partners Ken Howery and Luke Nosek. Thiel became Facebook's first outside investor when he acquired a 10.2% stake in the company for $500,000 in August 2004. He co-founded Valar Ventures in 2010, co-founded Mithril Capital, was investment committee chair, in 2012, and was a part-time partner at Y Combinator from 2015 to 2017. He was granted New Zealand citizenship in 2011, which later became controversial in New Zealand.\nVariously described as a conservative libertarian and democracy-skeptic authoritarian, Thiel has made substantial donations to American right-wing figures and causes. Through the Thiel Foundation, Thiel governs the grant-making bodies Breakout Labs and Thiel Fellowship. In 2016, when the Bollea v. Gawker lawsuit ended up with Gawker losing the case, Thiel confirmed that he had funded Hulk Hogan. Gawker had previously outed Thiel as gay."

[Read PDF](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.04432v1)\n\n**What the Literature Suggests About Quantum Randomness in Real-Time Use:**\n- Quantum randomness, while truly unpredictable, faces practical limitations in real-time systems:\n    - Hardware bottlenecks: Quantum random number generators (QRNGs) can experience bandwidth and interface delays that disrupt real-time guarantees.\n    - Testing and certification: True unpredictability complicates verification, which is critical in safety-constrained systems.\n    - Security vs. reliability tradeoffs: Quantum randomness, while harder to predict or replicate (good for security), can challenge determinism needed for reliable, traceable operation in control systems, safety loops, or low-latency environments.\n    - Classical subsystems: Integration with classical systems can introduce non-quantum bottlenecks, sometimes negating the theoretical benefits and introducing new points of failure.\n\n**Video Panel / Expert Interview Debating These Risks:**\n- [Quantum and the unknowable universe | FULL DEBATE | Roger Penrose, Sabine Hossenfelder, Slavoj Žižek](https://youtu.be/IdzXbIW9kxY) (The Institute of Art and Ideas, 45:43): A high-level debate among physicists and philosophers on where quantum indeterminacy challenges our ability to build and predict systems, and the philosophical and practical risk that true randomness introduces to engineered systems.\n- [Quantum Computing: Hype vs. Reality](https://youtu.be/-1PsQIciMEc) (World Science Festival, 44:45): A panel of quantum physicists and computer scientists (including Scott Aaronson and others) debate real-world limitations of quantum tech, including unpredictability, technical integration challenges, and practical risks.\n\n**Summary for Practitioners:**\n- Peer-reviewed work on quantum randomness in real-time systems is in early days; limitations most frequently cited are practical—hardware speeds, system integration, untestability, and risks to determinism.\n- When building real-time systems, using quantum randomness means carefully isolating critical safety/control logic from quantum-sourced indeterminacy where provable guarantees are still required.\n- Leading experts continue to debate whether, and how safely, true quantum randomness can be harnessed in high-stakes or time-critical environments—see the linked panels for in-depth professional discussion.\n\nIf you want code samples, more on hardware QRNG integration, or wish to discuss specific real-time architectures, let me know!"
