Kimchi fried rice is made primarily with kimchi and rice, along with other available ingredients, such as diced vegetables or meats like Spam.\n\nPage: Kimchi\nSummary: Kimchi (; Korean: 김치; RR: gimchi; pronounced [kim.tɕʰi]) is a traditional Korean side dish (banchan) consisting of salted and fermented vegetables, most often napa cabbage or Korean radish. A wide selection of seasonings are used, including gochugaru (Korean chili powder), spring onions, garlic, ginger, and jeotgal (salted seafood). Kimchi is also used in a variety of soups and stews. Kimchi is a staple food in Korean cuisine and is eaten as a side dish with almost every Korean meal.\nThere are hundreds of different types of kimchi made with different vegetables as the main ingredients. Examples of variants include baechu-kimchi, kkakdugi, chonggak-kimchi, and oi-sobagi. Traditionally, winter kimchi, called gimjang, was stored in large earthenware fermentation vessels, called onggi, in the ground to prevent freezing during the winter months and to keep it cool enough to slow down the fermentation process during summer months.  The process of making kimchi was called gimjang and was a way for the whole village to participate. The vessels are also kept outdoors in special terraces called jangdokdae. Recently, household kimchi refrigerators are more commonly used."

It is a traditional Korean side dish made primarily from salted and fermented vegetables, most commonly napa cabbage and Korean radish, flavored with various seasonings including chili pepper, garlic, ginger, and often salted seafood. The history of kimchi dates back over 2,000 years, with its earliest forms appearing during the Silla Dynasty. The dish evolved over centuries, reflecting the agricultural practices and climatic conditions of Korea. \n\nOne of the most significant aspects of kimchi is its role in Korean culture, where it is regarded as a staple food at nearly every meal, serving not just as a condiment but also as a source of nutrition and probiotics. The process of making kimchi, known as 'gimjang', is a communal activity traditionally involving the whole family or community, especially in preparation for the harsh winter months. During this time, large quantities of kimchi were prepared and stored in special clay pots called 'onggi', buried in the ground to control the fermentation process. \n\nKimchi embodies the spirit of Korean cuisine that emphasizes preservation techniques, communal living, and seasonal eating. Its health benefits and distinct taste have made it popular around the world, further solidifying its status as Korea's most emblematic dish."
