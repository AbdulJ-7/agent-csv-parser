Accordingly, the pandemic has been generating unprecedent disruption\\non practically every aspect of society. This paper demonstrates that\\nhigh-frequency electricity market data can be used to estimate the causal,\\nshort-run impact of COVID-19 on the economy. In the current uncertain economic\\nconditions, timeliness is essential. Unlike official statistics, which are\\npublished with a delay of a few months, with our approach one can monitor\\nvirtually every day the impact of the containment policies, the extent of the\\nrecession and measure whether the monetary and fiscal stimuli introduced to\\naddress the crisis are being effective. We illustrate our methodology on daily\\ndata for the Italian day-ahead power market.

This study focuses on quantifying the\\nvariations of on-road fuel economy relative to official government ratings\\n(fuel economy gap) and seeks proper characterizations for the degree of\\nstochastic dependence between the fuel economy gaps of pairs of vehicles.By\\nusing unique data reported by customers of the U.S. government website\\nwww.fueleconomy.gov, the study presents an innovative copula-based\\njoint-modeling and forecasting framework for exploring the complex stochastic\\ndependencies (both nonlinear and non-normal) between the fuel economy gaps of\\nvehicles reported by the same person. While the EPA label estimates are similar\\nto the average numbers reported by website customers, significant, non-linear\\nvariation exists in the fuel economy gaps for the two vehicles across the\\nsample. In particular, a positive dependence, characterized by Student-t\\ncopula, is observed between the fuel economy gaps of the two vehicles with\\nsignificant dependencies in the tails of the bivariate distribution; a pair in\\nwhich one vehicle achieves better (worse) fuel economy is likely to contain a\\nsecond vehicle getting better (worse) fuel economy as well. However, the\\nresults also suggest that the strength of overall association is weak (Kendall\\nTau = 0.28).

By using\\na unique fuel economy database (fueleconomy.gov), users self-reported fuel\\neconomy estimates and government fuel economy ratings are analyzed for more\\nthan 7000 garages across the U.S. The empirical analysis, nonetheless, is\\ncomplicated owing to the presence of important methodological concerns\\nincluding potential interrelationship between vehicles within the same garage\\nand unobserved heterogeneity. To address these concerns, bivariate seemingly\\nunrelated fixed and random parameter models are presented. With government test\\ncycle ratings tending to over-estimate the actual on-road fuel economy, a\\nsignificant variation is observed in the fuel economy gaps for the two vehicles\\nacross garages. A wide variety of factors such as driving style, fuel economy\\ncalculation method, and several vehicle specific characteristics are\\nconsidered. Drivers who drive for maximum gas mileage or drives with the\\ntraffic flow have greater on-road fuel economy relative to the government\\nofficial ratings. Contrarily, volatile drivers have smaller on-road fuel\\neconomy relative to the official ratings. Compared to the previous findings,\\nour analysis suggests that the relationship between fuel type and fuel economy\\ngaps is complex and not unidirectional.

Overall, we find that the shutdown of third-party\\napps had no discernible impact on overall platform activity.
