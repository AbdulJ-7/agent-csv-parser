Our investigation utilized computational biology approaches combining multi-omics analysis with machine intelligence to elucidate the role of palmitoylation-related genes (PRGs) in PC pathogenesis and prognosis. By harmonizing transcriptomic datasets from TCGA and GEO repositories, we identified dysregulated PRGs and stratified PC into two molecularly distinct subtypes via unsupervised clustering. These subtypes exhibited divergent clinical outcomes, immune microenvironment heterogeneity (e.g., Dendritic cells, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, and Macrophages infiltration), and distinct drug sensitivity profiles. Single-cell RNA sequencing further localized key PRGs-ZDHHC2, ZDHHC5, ZDHHC15, ZDHHC9, and LYPLA1-within tumor cell populations, linking their expression to immune evasion and metabolic reprogramming. A robust diagnostic model, integrating 101 machine learning algorithms, demonstrated high predictive accuracy for survival and immunotherapy response. Functional validation in DU145 cells confirmed that modulating these PRGs significantly suppressed proliferation and colony formation, highlighting their pathobiological relevance. Collectively, this multidimensional analysis delineates a comprehensive framework for understanding palmitoylation-driven oncogenesis and establishes a precision medicine toolkit for risk stratification and treatment optimization in PC.\",\n      \"uid\": \"41116964\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"published\": \"2025-10-20\",\n      \"title\": \"Biomolecular condensates in Hippo pathway regulation.\",\n      \"copyright\": \"\",\n      \"summary\": \"Hippo signaling is a highly conserved pathway central to diverse cellular processes. Dysregulation of this pathway not only leads to developmental abnormalities but is also closely related to the occurrence and progression of various cancers. Recent studies have uncovered that, in addition to the classical signaling cascade regulation, biomolecular condensates formed via phase separation play a key role in the spatiotemporal regulation of Hippo signaling. In this review, we provide a summary of the latest research progress on the regulation of the Hippo signaling pathway by phase separation, with a particular focus on transcriptional activation mediated by Yes-associated protein (YAP)/transcriptional coactivator with post-synaptic density-95, disks-large, and zonula occludens-1 (PDZ)-binding domain (TAZ) condensates. Furthermore, we discuss the utility of chemical crosslinking combined with mass spectrometry to analyze the TAZ condensate interactome and examine the role of the protein fused in sarcoma (FUS) in modulating the biophysical properties of TAZ condensates, which in turn influence their transcriptional activity and pro-tumorigenic functions. These insights not only advance our understanding of Hippo signaling but also offer new perspectives for therapeutic interventions targeting diseases linked to dysregulated YAP/TAZ activity.\",\n      \"uid\": \"41116205\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"published\": \"2025-10-20\",\n      \"title\": \"Circadian genes <i>CLOCK</i> and <i>BMAL1</i> in cancer: mechanistic insights and therapeutic strategies.\",\n      \"copyright\": \"\",\n      \"summary\": \"The circadian clock is a highly conserved timekeeping system in organisms, which maintains physiological homeostasis by precisely regulating periodic fluctuations in gene expression. Substantial clinical and experimental evidence has established a close association between circadian rhythm disruption and the development of various malignancies. Research has revealed characteristic alterations in the circadian gene expression profiles in tumor tissues, primarily manifested as a dysfunction of core clock components (particularly circadian locomotor output cycles kaput (CLOCK) and brain and muscle ARNT-like 1 (BMAL1)) and the widespread dysregulation of their downstream target genes. Notably, <i>CLOCK</i> demonstrates non-canonical oncogenic functions, including epigenetic regulation via histone acetyltransferase activity and the circadian-independent modulation of cancer pathways. This review systematically elaborates on the oncogenic mechanisms mediated by CLOCK/BMAL1, encompassing multidimensional effects such as cell cycle control, DNA damage response, metabolic reprogramming, and tumor microenvironment (TME) remodeling. Regarding the therapeutic strategies, we focus on cutting-edge approaches such as chrononutritional interventions, chronopharmacological modulation, and treatment regimen optimization, along with a discussion of future perspectives. The research breakthroughs highlighted in this work not only deepen our understanding of the crucial role of circadian regulation in cancer biology but also provide novel insights for the development of chronotherapeutic oncology, particularly through targeting the non-canonical functions of circadian proteins to develop innovative anti-cancer strategies.\",\n      \"uid\": \"41116204\"\n    }\n  ]\n}"

      "content": "# Common Causes, Signs, and Symptoms of Cancer\n\n## Common Causes of Cancer\n\nCancer develops when cells in the body begin to grow and divide uncontrollably. Several factors can contribute to cancer development:\n\n**1. Genetic and Cellular Factors**\n- Mutations in genes that control cell growth and division\n- Loss of function in tumor suppressor genes\n- Activation of oncogenes\n- Inherited genetic predisposition\n\n**2. Environmental Factors**\n- **UV radiation**: Significant risk factor for skin cancer\n- **Tobacco use**: Major cause of lung, throat, and mouth cancers\n- **Radiation exposure**: Including over-exposure to radiation therapy\n- **Chemical exposures**: Various carcinogenic substances\n\n**3. Lifestyle Factors**\n- Diet and nutrition\n- Physical inactivity\n- Alcohol consumption\n- Chronic inflammation\n\n**4. Biological Factors**\n- Certain viral infections\n- Chronic conditions\n- Age (risk increases with age)\n- Family medical history\n\n---\n\n## Common Signs and Symptoms of Cancer\n\n**Important Note**: These symptoms can be caused by many conditions other than cancer. Only a doctor can determine if symptoms are cancer-related.\n\n### General Warning Signs:\n\n**1. Unexplained Weight Loss**\n- Often one of the first notable signs\n- Particularly associated with cancers of the esophagus, lung, pancreas, or stomach\n- Ovarian cancer may cause weight loss when tumor presses against the stomach\n\n**2. Lumps or Thickening**\n- New or persistent lumps anywhere in the body\n- Common in breast, neck, or under the skin\n- Should always be evaluated by a healthcare provider\n\n**3. Abnormal Bleeding or Discharge**\n- Blood in urine or stool\n- Unusual vaginal bleeding (especially post-menopause)\n- Nipple discharge\n- Any unexplained bleeding should be investigated\n\n**4. Persistent Pain**\n- Pain that has no clear cause\n- Doesn't respond to standard treatments\n- Bone cancer often hurts from the beginning\n- Persistent headaches that don't improve\n\n**5. Extreme Fatigue**\n- Sudden, lasting change in energy level\n- Doesn't improve with rest\n- Cancer uses body's nutrients, causing \"nutrient theft\"\n- Can be a sign of leukemia or lymphoma\n\n**6. Changes in Bowel or Bladder Habits**\n- Prolonged constipation or diarrhea\n- Changes in stool appearance (thin, ribbon-like stool)\n- Difficulty urinating\n- Blood in urine or stool\n\n**7. Persistent Cough or Hoarseness**\n- Prolonged cough that doesn't go away\n- Hoarseness lasting longer than 3-4 weeks\n- May indicate throat or lung cancer\n\n**8. Skin Changes**\n- New moles or changes to existing moles\n- Sores that don't heal\n- White patches in the mouth (leukoplakia)\n- Changes in skin color or texture\n\n**9. Fever and Night Sweats**\n- Persistent unexplained fever\n- Excessive night sweats\n- Common in blood cancers\n\n**10. Abnormal Bumps**\n- Any new or growing bumps should be evaluated\n- Particularly concerning if they don't go away\n\n### Specific Cancer Type Symptoms:\n\n**Breast Cancer:**\n- Swelling, redness, or flaky skin on breast\n- Nipple discharge or inverted nipple\n- Lump or growth in breast\n- Dimpling (orange peel appearance)\n- Pain or tenderness under the arm\n\n**Colorectal Cancer:**\n- Constipation and/or diarrhea\n- Blood in stool or rectal bleeding\n- Abdominal cramps or pain\n- Bloated or full feeling\n\n**Lung Cancer:**\n- Often doesn't cause symptoms until advanced stage\n- Persistent cough\n- Chest pain\n- Difficulty breathing\n\n**Gynecologic Cancers:**\n- Increased urinary frequency (if not pregnant or drinking more water)\n- Abdominal pain and bloating\n- Feeling full quickly\n\n---\n\n## When to See a Doctor\n\n**Seek medical attention if you experience:**\n- Any symptoms that persist or worsen\n- Multiple symptoms occurring together\n- Symptoms severe enough to affect quality of life\n- Any unexplained changes in your body\n\n**Remember**: Early detection significantly improves treatment outcomes. Most symptoms are caused by conditions other than cancer, but it's essential to get them checked by a healthcare professional.\n\n---\n\n# Educational Videos on Introduction to Cancer Biology\n\nHere are excellent educational videos that explain cancer biology:\n\n## Top Recommended Videos:\n\n**1.
