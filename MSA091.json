Contrary to the traditional perception of ML in\\nresearch, ML workflows can be complex, resource-intensive, and time-consuming.\\nExpanding an ML workflow to encompass a wider range of data infrastructure and\\ndata types may lead to larger workloads and increased deployment costs.\\nCurrently, numerous workflow engines are available (with over ten being widely\\nrecognized). This variety poses a challenge for end-users in terms of mastering\\ndifferent engine APIs. While efforts have primarily focused on optimizing ML\\nOperations (MLOps) for a specific workflow engine, current methods largely\\noverlook workflow optimization across different engines.\\n  In this work, we design and implement Couler, a system designed for unified\\nML workflow optimization in the cloud. Our main insight lies in the ability to\\ngenerate an ML workflow using natural language (NL) descriptions. We integrate\\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) into workflow generation, and provide a unified\\nprogramming interface for various workflow engines. This approach alleviates\\nthe need to understand various workflow engines' APIs. Moreover, Couler\\nenhances workflow computation efficiency by introducing automated caching at\\nmultiple stages, enabling large workflow auto-parallelization and automatic\\nhyperparameters tuning. These enhancements minimize redundant computational\\ncosts and improve fault tolerance during deep learning workflow training.\\nCouler is extensively deployed in real-world production scenarios at Ant Group,\\nhandling approximately 22k workflows daily, and has successfully improved the\\nCPU/Memory utilization by more than 15% and the workflow completion rate by\\naround 17%.\",\n      \"published\": \"2024-03-12\",\n      \"arxiv_id\": \"2403.07608v1\",\n      \"pdf_url\": \"http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.07608v1\",\n      \"categories\": [\n        \"cs.DB\",\n        \"cs.AI\",\n        \"cs.LG\"\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"title\": \"Demystifying a Dark Art: Understanding Real-World Machine Learning Model Development\",\n      \"authors\": \"Angela Lee, Doris Xin, Doris Lee, Aditya Parameswaran\",\n      \"summary\": \"It is well-known that the process of developing machine learning (ML)\\nworkflows is a dark-art; even experts struggle to find an optimal workflow\\nleading to a high accuracy model.
